linux/0001-Treat-IPv4-lowest-address-as-ordinary-unicast-address.patch

        This patch was committed on 2021-05-17.  See

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net-next.git/commit/net/ipv4?id=94c821c74bf5fe0c25e09df5334a16f98608db90

measurement/probe-busybox/0001-Reduce-special-cases-for-IPv4-address-space.patch

	A narrower version of this patch (continuing to exclude all of 224/4
	and 127/8) was adopted by the RIPE Atlas project at the beginning of
	March 2021.  (EDIT: We are double-checking on this; it might not
	actually have been merged at that time.)

	It will require corresponding changes in the RIPE Atlas backend in
	order to request probes to test reserved address space (since scans
	that specify reserved address targets numerically are blocked from
	doing so by both the probe software and the backend).

	Dave further noted that this is one of three accepted patches on
	OpenWrt that completed 240/4 support for OpenWrt 19.01.

	* Backport of Linux 4.20 ifconfig ioctl. Status: ACCEPTED.
	* Removal of IN_EXPERIMENTAL check in netifd. Status: ACCEPTED.
	* Removal of 240/4 from BCP38 package. Status: ACCEPTED.

	(The OpenWrt patch history for the first and last of these is
	apparently not recorded in the Unicast Extensions repository.)
